What instructions is “c=a+b;” converted to?

        movl -4(%ebp),%eax      
        addl -8(%ebp),%eax
        movl %eax,-12(%ebp)


        This follows the read - update - write. So first 'a' is read and stored in %eax. I know -4(%ebp) is referring to int a because
        it was 'initialized' first therefore it is 4 bytes away from the address at the bottom of the current stack frame. The value 13 is now placed
        in register %eax. The value in %eax is now being updated using addition and the value of 'b'. I know this is referring to int b
        because it was 'initialized' after int a which makes it 4 bytes away from int a and 8 bytes away from the bottom of the current stack
        frame. The value 5 is now added to the value 13 that is in %eax. The last line now takes the value in %eax and stores (this is the writes
        step) it in the address that is 12 bytes away from the bottom of the stack which in this case is c.
